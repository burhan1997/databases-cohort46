1. The table provided is not in the First Normal Form (1NF) because it contains repeating groups. Specifically, the food_code and food_description columns contain multiple values separated by commas, which is a violation of 1NF.

2. Entities to Extract
From the given table, i can extract the following entities:

-Member (member_id, member_name, member_address)
-Dinner (dinner_id, dinner_date)
-Venue (venue_code, venue_description)
-Food (food_code, food_description)

3.Tables and Columns for a 3NF Compliant Solution
To create a 3NF compliant solution, we can create separate tables for each entity and then use foreign keys to establish relationships between them.

1-Member Table

member_id (Primary Key)
member_name
member_address

2-Dinner Table

dinner_id (Primary Key)
dinner_date

3-Venue Table

venue_code (Primary Key)
venue_description

4-Food Table

food_code (Primary Key)
food_description

5-Dinner_Member Table (Many-to-Many Relationship)

dinner_id (Foreign Key to Dinner Table)
member_id (Foreign Key to Member Table)

6-Dinner_Venue Table (One-to-Many Relationship)

dinner_id (Foreign Key to Dinner Table)
venue_code (Foreign Key to Venue Table)

7-Dinner_Food Table (Many-to-Many Relationship)

dinner_id (Foreign Key to Dinner Table)
food_code (Foreign Key to Food Table)

In this way, we ensure that the database is in Third Normal Form (3NF). This structure also allows for more flexibility in managing the information about dinners and members of the dinner club.
